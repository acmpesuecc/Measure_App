# Contributing Guidelines :

  ### Thanks for taking the time to contribute!
  
  This project is simpler than most, so itâ€™s a good place to start contributing to the open source community.

  We are accepting these sorts of changes and requests:

    Bug reports and fixes
    Usability improvements
    Documentation updates

We are not accepting things that should be done in your own wrapper code:

    Personal customizations and preferences
    Modified or augmented outputs that are not instrinsic
